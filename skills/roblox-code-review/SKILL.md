# Code Review

Review Roblox projects with security, performance, and monetization lenses. Apply relevant lenses based on what changed — not all every time.

## When to Load

- User asks for code review on Roblox/Luau code
- User asks to audit security, performance, networking, monetization, or data persistence
- User asks about Roblox best practices for remotes, data saving, or code organization

## Quick Reference

### 8-Step Review
1. **Project Scan** — scripts, folders, naming, Rojo/Wally/Studio
2. **Organization** — correct services, PascalCase modules, no orphans
3. **Code Quality** — `wait()`→`task.wait()`, `spawn()`→`task.spawn()`, globals
4. **Architecture** — single responsibility, no circular requires, server/client split
5. **Security** — validate remotes server-side, no client-trusted state, rate-limit
6. **Performance** — consolidate Heartbeat, cache services, disconnect events
7. **Report** — Grade A-F. Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
8. **Refactor** — Immediate → Short-term → Long-term
