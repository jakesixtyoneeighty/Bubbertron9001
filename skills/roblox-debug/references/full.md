# Iterative Debug Loop — Full Reference


> **Code in this reference is illustrative. Adapt to your game and verify in Studio before production use.**

You are performing an iterative debug loop on a Roblox project. Follow these 7 steps. The loop has a maximum of **5 iterations** before escalating to the user.

---

## Step 1: Error Gathering

**Sync Mode (files on disk):**
Read the error from the user's description or ask them to paste the error message, stack trace, and any relevant output.

**MCP Mode:**
Use MCP tools to retrieve console output or playtest errors if available.

Record:
- Error message (exact text)
- Stack trace (script name + line number)
- When it occurs (on join, on action, on timer, etc.)

---

## Step 2: Code Discovery

Read the relevant script(s) from the synced folder (or via MCP if in MCP-Only Mode). Search for the error message, relevant function names, or the script from the stack trace.

---

## Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

Analyze the error against common Roblox issue categories. Load `skills/roblox-sharp-edges/SKILL.md` for known gotchas.

Categorize the error:
- **Syntax** - Missing `end`, typos, incorrect syntax
- **Runtime** - nil access, missing service, Instance destroyed
- **Logic** - Wrong calculation, incorrect condition, missing state
- **Security** - Client-side issue that should be server-side, unvalidated remote
- **Performance** - Timeout, memory, script contention

If the `roblox-sharp-edges` skill is available, load it for known gotchas. Otherwise, proceed with general Luau knowledge.

Identify:
1. The exact line(s) causing the error
2. Why the error occurs (root cause, not symptom)
3. Whether this is a standalone bug or a symptom of a deeper issue

---

## Step 4: Generate Fix

Produce corrected Luau code with an explanation of:
- What was wrong (the root cause)
- Why the fix works
- Any related code that should also be checked

If the fix involves architectural changes (not just a line fix), explain the change clearly and suggest where else the same pattern applies.

---

## Step 5: Apply & Test

Write the fix to the synced file. If MCP is available, use it to verify the fix applies cleanly. If playtest is running, check for errors after the fix.

If in offline mode, provide the corrected code with clear before/after diff and manual test instructions.

---

## Step 6: Verify

Check if the error is resolved:
- If **resolved**: Proceed to Step 7
- If **new errors appear**: Update error record, return to Step 1 with new information
- If **same error persists**: Try a different root cause hypothesis, return to Step 3
- If **iteration count = 5**: Stop and escalate to user with full diagnosis

Track iteration count. After 5 attempts, output:
1. All attempted fixes and why each was rejected
2. Remaining hypotheses
3. Recommended next steps (manual investigation, Roblox DevForum search, etc.)

---

## Step 7: Summary

Document the completed fix:

1. **Bug description** - What was happening
2. **Root cause** - Why it was happening
3. **Fix applied** - Exact changes made
4. **Verification** - How it was confirmed fixed
5. **Related risks** - Other places that might have the same issue
6. **Prevention** - Pattern to follow to avoid this class of bug in the future

If the bug revealed a systemic issue, recommend running `/code-review` for a full scan.
